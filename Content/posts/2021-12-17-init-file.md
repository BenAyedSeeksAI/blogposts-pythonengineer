This article explains why the `__init__.py` file exists in Python packages.

There are two types of packages in python, regular and namespace packages. The former requires `__init__.py` file whereas the latter does not. Any directory with an init python file is marked as a package by python and can be imported.

Whenever a package is imported using the `import` keyword or the `from x import y` syntax the init file is run implicitly. Generally, this file is kept empty but it can be used to achieve the following things:

- Import submodules
- Initialize top-level objects/variables (logger, database connections, configurations)


### Working with `__init__.py` file

First, let's create a directory named `my_package` and add a new file `__init__.py` with this content
```python
print("my_package is imported")
```

With this setup, we can now test if `my_package` can be imported using the following script
```python
import my_package
```

Output:
```console
my_package is imported
```

As we can see, as soon as `my_package` was imported the init file was run. Similarly, several submodules can be created with their own `__init__.py` file. For example

```console
my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── sub_package_1
│   └── __init__.py
├── sub_package_2
│   └── __init__.py
└── sub_package_3
    └── __init__.py

3 directories, 4 files
```

Similar content is written into all init files as in the `my_package` init file. We can then import all submodules

```python
from my_package import sub_package_1, sub_package_2, sub_package_3
```

Output:
```console
my_package is imported
sub_package_1 is imported
sub_package_2 is imported
sub_package_3 is imported
```
