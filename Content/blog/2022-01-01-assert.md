Assert statement in python is a way to check for unrecoverable conditions before proceeding further in a program. 
It prevents runtime errors by evaluating causes that could certainly raise an error after performing a few operations. 
It is similar to a self-checking mechanism for a program, a bug-free program should not be affected by asserts. An assert is equivalent to:

```python
if not condition:
    raise AssertionError("my-message")
``` 

When a python program is run in an optimized mode (where *\_\_debug\_\_* is False), as shown below, assert is ignored.

```console
python -O main.py
```

The assert statement needs an expression to evaluate and an optional message, the expression should result in a Boolean value, True or False. If the result is False an [AssertionError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError) is raised with provided message. 

Syntax:

```python
assert <expression> [, "message"]
```

Following are a few sample usages of assert

### Check if a number is even

```python
assert num % 2 == 0, "Number is not even"
```

### Checking for membership in a list

```python
assert 2 in [1, 3, 4], "2 is not in the list"
```

### Leap year detection

```python
assert (year % 400 == 0 and year % 100 == 0) or (year % 4 ==0 and year % 100 != 0), f"{year} is not a leap year"
```

### Usage in a function

```python
def apply_discount(price: float, discount: float) -> float:
    assert 0 <= discount <= 100 # discount is in percentage
    discounted_price = price - (price * discount / 100)
    return discounted_price
```
